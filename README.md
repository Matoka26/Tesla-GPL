# Tesla-GPL
The final project made by me and my colleagues in a robotics stage in Python, through an Erasmus+ partnership in Spain.
There are 2 microcontrollers,one being the transmitter,sending instructions to the receiver which acts it's servomotors to move. 
Basically a remote control car with a toy sticked on it (a yeti i guess).
